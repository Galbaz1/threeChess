We want to build a single function which can call any llm api provider in the most modular and reasonable way possible.

apis we will be using:
openai (default model: gpt-4o)
anthropic(default model: claude-3-5-sonnet-latest) we have to from anthropic import AsyncAnthropic for this one. takes system message as a parameter, must have model and max_tokens=8000 specified
openrouter(default model: google/gemini-flash-1.5-8b)
groq (default model: llama-3.3-70b-versatile) 


lets use openai library with base_url changes whenever we can
from openai import AsyncOpenAI

function should also take in the messages list
